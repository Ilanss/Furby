                    <div class="number"><p>1</p></div><div class="text"><p>Do some research on the type of Furby you’d like. There are nine types of Furbys. There are the original 1998 Furbys, the 1999 Furby Babies, the 2001 Shelbys, the 2005 Emototronic Furbys, the 2012 Furbys, the Furby Party Rockerz, the Furby Booms, the Furblings, and Furbacca. Research pictures and videos of these Furbys to decide on a favorite. All of these are very different, and this is important to note when choosing your Furby.</p></div>
                    <div class="img_pop"><img src="img/furby-spa-2.jpg" alt=""></div>
                    <div class="number"><p>2</p></div><div class="text"><p>Decide if you’d like an original 1998 Furby. Original 1998 Furbys are ideal for a new Furby owner. They are simple to operate and easy to learn to care for. If you decide on getting an original Furby, you can choose from seven different generations. Please note that many original Furbys will no longer start up when they are new in box. If you do not know how to repair a Furby, try finding one in working condition.</p></div>
                    <div class="img_pop"><img src="img/furby-spa-3.jpg" alt=""></div>
                    <div class="number"><p>3</p></div><div class="text"><p>Decide if you’d enjoy caring for a toy more like a baby then a friend or pet. Furby Babies are very similar to original Furbys, except that they are smaller and have additional “baby” vocabulary. Furby Babies are best for more experienced owners, as they require more attention than most Furbys do. If you choose a Furby Baby, you have four generations to choose from. Like original Furbys, some new in box Babies no longer work.</p></div>
                    <div class="img_pop"><img src="img/furby-spa-4.jpg" alt=""></div>
                    <div class="number"><p>4</p></div><div class="text"><p>Make a decision on whether you want a real Furby or a Furby Friend. If you’d like a Furby friend, then you might like a Shelby! The Shelby is a toy from the makers of Furby. Shelby is a clam, and was released in two different generations. Shelbys are also for the more experienced owner, as they do require lots of attention. Many Shelbys are still in working order, and you have a good chance of getting one to work from the box.</p></div>
                    <div class="img_pop"><img src="img/furby-spa-5.jpg" alt=""></div>
                    <div class="number"><p>5</p></div><div class="text"><p>Decide if you’d like your Furby to be more interactive. Emototronic Furbys are the most interactive Furbys. The Emototronic Furby was a new variation of Furby which included more facial expression and voice recognition. These Furbys will respond to commands and are a good Furby for a first time owner, as they have an off switch and don’t require much care. There are many colors to choose from, and many of these Furbys are still in working order.</p></div>
                    <div class="img_pop"><img src="img/furby-spa-6.jpg" alt=""></div>
                    <div class="number"><p>6</p></div><div class="text"><p>Decide whether you want an older Furby or a newer one. If you’d like a newer one, then the 2012 Furby is a great choice. 2012 Furby was a re-release of the original toy. 2012 Furby has LED eyes, and can change personalities. This Furby even has an app for Apple and Android devices, from which you can feed and communicate with the Furby. These Furbys are a bit harder to care for, and may not be a good choice for a first time owner. Almost all of these Furbys are still in working order and ready to play!</p></div>
                    <div class="img_pop"><img src="img/furby-spa-7.jpg" alt=""></div>
                    <div class="number"><p>7</p></div><div class="text"><p>Think about whether you'd like a smaller Furby. Furby Party Rockerz were another toy released in the Furby line in 2013. They were smaller, and would become more wild when you shake them. They also respond to the Furby app. Despite their small size, Party Rockerz are quite difficult to care for, and are very sensitive to movement. They will often wake up if you walk past them. These Furbys come in a few different variations, and almost all still work. But this Furby may not be the best choice for a first time owner. If you are still interested in a small Furby, then a Furbling is a great choice. They aren’t the most interactive, and only respond when you pet its head. They come in all of the same colors as the Furby Boom, and are a great choice for a first time owner!</p></div>
                    <div class="img_pop"><img src="img/furby-spa-8.jpg" alt=""></div>
                    <div class="number"><p>8</p></div><div class="text"><p>Decide if you’d like a colorful and modern Furby. The Furby Boom was released in 2013 and came in multiple colorful patterns. Like the 2012 Furby, Furby Boom has LED eyes and multiple personalities. Furby Boom has its own app, where you hatch and raise Furblings, as well as care for your Furby Boom. Furby Boom can also be very sensitive to movement, but is a good choice for an experienced owner. All of these Furbys will work unless they have some sort of manufacturing defect.</p></div>
                    <div class="img_pop"><img src="img/furby-spa-9.jpg" alt=""></div>
                    <div class="number"><p>9</p></div><div class="text"><p>Decide if you’d like something slightly different than a classic Furby. Furbacca is a Furby based off of the Star Wars character, Chewbacca. It features Chewbacca’s shaggy brown fur, and belt. Furbacca even speaks Wookie! He has his own app, where you can hatch and raise Star Wars Furblings, as well as care for Furbacca. Furbacca is lots of fun, and is great for any Star Wars fan!</p></div>

                    <div class="number"><p>11</p></div><div class="text"><p>Consider the price range you’d like to pay. If you are looking to pay less, then a used Furby may be best for you. If you are willing to pay a bit more, then you can get a Furby new in box.</p></div>
                    <div class="img_pop"><img src="img/furby-spa-12.jpg" alt=""></div>
                    <div class="number"><p>12</p></div><div class="text"><p>Choose where you’d like to buy your Furby from. You can only find Furby Boom, Furbacca, and Furblings in stores. Any other Furby must be obtained online. EBay and Amazon are great places to find Furbys!</p></div>
                    <div class="img_pop"><img src="img/furby-spa-13.jpg" alt=""></div>
